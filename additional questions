Confused which on roster.cpp goes onto header
Not sure if I succeeded in creating student objects that then get stored in the array
Didn't parse data? How to?
Didn't meet E. part of prompt
Having trouble with public and parenthesis on cpp
	Is it supposed to be in header because of public void request and error
		class BaseClass {
		  public:
		  BaseClass(const char* aHow = NULL) {
		  std::strcpy(ivHow,aHow);
		  }...
		
		From <https://www.bing.com/search?q=c%2b%2b+expected+an+expression+public&FORM=R5FD1> 
		
Didn't set pointers right?
Can I use vectors and array without disregarding brief?
Do I need empty constructors and for loop on student.cpp?
